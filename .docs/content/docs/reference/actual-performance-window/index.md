# Actual Performance Window

Actual Performance Window is a window to see Performance Rank of your Avatar in Play Mode or 
just after building your avatar without launching your VRChat Client.

If you have some non-destructive avatar modification tools you can preview on entering Play Mode
such as [Avatar Optimizer] or [Modular Avatar], You can see performance rank in Play Mode preview.

If you have multiple avatars in your scene, You can select avatar to see performance rank at the top of the window.

This performance rank shown in this window is calculated by VRCSDK,
however it may not be same as VRChat Client because of VRChat's changes.

## How to add this tool to your project {#how-to-add-to-project}

Enable 'AlignXAxisOnPlaneWithYRotation' in the selector window. Please refer [Basic Usage] page for more details.
