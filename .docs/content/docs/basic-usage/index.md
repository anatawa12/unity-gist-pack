# Basic Usage

anatawa12's gist pack for Unity consists of multiple gists so after installing this package, you have to enable some gists.

Please open selector window from `Tools/anatawa12's gist selector`, check gists you want to enable, and click `Apply Changes`.

With the `Search` field at the top, you can filter by name or description.

Some package cannot be enabled because some dependency is missing.

For example, SetRandomBlueprintId is made for VRCSDK Base so if your project doesn't have VRCSDK Base, this is disabled. \
Also, ActualPerformanceWindow is made for VRCSDK Avatars so if your project doesn't have VRCSDK Avatars, this is disabled.
